# Arda Janus WebRTC Server

This repository provides the Dockerfile to build a full-featured docker image for the [Janus WebRTC Server](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway) that is meant for playing with Arda Projects.

Janus is an open source, general purpose, WebRTC server designed and developed by [Meetecho](http://www.meetecho.com). This version of the server is tailored for Linux systems, although it can be compiled for, and installed on, MacOS machines as well. Windows is not supported, but if that's a requirement, Janus is known to work in the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" on Windows 10.
